    <div class="motivation">
      <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>The motivation for this project is to create visualizations for the use of Little Brothers - Friends of the Elderly (LB).
        LB is a nonprofit organization that pairs students with elderly people that suffer from loneliness, and loss of self-sufficiency.
        The goal of LB chapters is to create genuine relationships and create companionship. We were drawn to the idea of this, 
        and wanted to aid in their funding efforts by creating this visualization.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="data">
      <h3>Data</h3>
        <p>Data  for our visualizations comes from public Boston Housing Authority records. Some of the data is categorical, like the
        name of the BHA development, and the location of it. There is also a lot of qualitative data about the metrics of each 
        development. For example, there are metrics on ethnicities, annual incomes, and overall population of the developments.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="taskanalysis">
      <h3>Task Analysis</h3>
        <p>We conducted an interview with Cynthia Wilkerson, our main point of contact for this project. From this we found the main 
        goal of our visualization, and what tasks Cynthia hopes to be able to perform when using our visualization. Those tasks are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Finding locations for LB program sites.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate effects of increased funding for LB.</li>
            <li>Show coverage of LB programs by region.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="buttons">

    </div>
    <div class="dataanalysis">
      <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
        <p>In our preliminary run-through of the data, there were a few things to note. Some of the BHA housing developments are much 
        larger than others. This allows us to see which developments have a higher demand for LB sites based on their populations. 
        The majority of the people who live in these developments have an annual income of about $5k - $15k. The most common ethnicities
         are black, hispanic, and white. The data also records the most common ages for their tenants. This allows us to better narrow
         down BHA developments to find the best targets for Little Brothers.</p>
  </div>
    <div class="conclusion">
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Our visualization is an interactive map that shows the loactions of BHA developments, high schools and colleges, and 
        Little Brothers program sites. It is capable of placing prospective LB program sites to show which schools and BHA 
        developments it might be able to reach, with a slider for the radius. It does a bunch of other cool stuff too.</p>
